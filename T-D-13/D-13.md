Multi-Branch Project

Project Overview

This project involves creating a simple Java Maven application, version-controlling it using Git with multiple branches, and setting up a Jenkins multi-branch pipeline for automated build and deployment. The Jenkinsfile will utilize environment variables to manage different configurations.

Introduction

The Multi-Branch Project is designed to demonstrate the use of Git for version control, Maven for project management, and Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment. The goal is to create a robust CI/CD pipeline that automates the build and deployment process across different branches.
Project Objectives

    Version-control using Git: Implement multiple branches (development, staging, and production) and push the repository to a remote Git server.
    Jenkins multi-branch pipeline setup: Configure Jenkins to handle multiple branches and automate the build and deployment process.
    Environment variable management using Jenkinsfile: Utilize Jenkins environment variables to manage different configurations for various branches.

Project Deliverables

    Git Repository:
        Local Git repository initialized.
        Branches: development, staging, and production.
        Repository pushed to a remote Git server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

    Maven Project:
        Simple Java Maven project created (HelloWorld application).
        pom.xml with dependencies and build configurations.

    Jenkins Setup:
        Multi-branch pipeline job configured in Jenkins.
        Jenkinsfile defining build and deployment steps.
        Environment variables managed using Jenkins environment variable settings.

Installation
Prerequisites
