Assessment: Use Case Oriented Project

Project Overview
You are tasked with setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices-based application. The
application will be containerized using Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes. Ansible
will be used for configuration management and deployment. The entire setup should be
managed using Git for version control, and Jenkins will be used to automate the CI/CD
process.
Assessment Criteria
1. Git:
○ Repository setup
○ Branching strategies
○ Commit and merge practices
2. Jenkins:
○ Pipeline creation using Jenkinsfile
○ Integration with Git
○ Automated build, test, and deployment stages
3. Docker:
○ Dockerfile creation
○ Image building and management
○ Containerization of microservices
4. Kubernetes:
○ Pod and service creation
○ Deployments and replica sets
○ ConfigMaps and Secrets
5. Ansible:
○ Playbook creation
○ Use of variables and templates
○ Inventory management
Use Case Scenario
Your company is developing a new e-commerce application consisting of several
microservices: a front-end service, a product catalog service, and an order processing
service. The goal is to automate the deployment and configuration of these services across
development, testing, and production environments using Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and
Jenkins.
Tasks and Deliverables








Task 1: Git Repository Setup

1. Create a Git repository to store all project files, including Ansible playbooks,
Dockerfiles, and Kubernetes manifests.
2. Branching Strategy:
○ Create branches for development, testing, and production.
○ Implement a strategy for merging changes from development to testing and
Production.

Task 2: Dockerize Microservices

1. Create Dockerfiles for each microservice (front-end, product catalog, order
processing).
2. Build Docker images for each microservice and push them to a container registry
(e.g., Docker Hub).
3. Deliverables:
○ Dockerfiles for each microservice
○ Built Docker images in a container registry
