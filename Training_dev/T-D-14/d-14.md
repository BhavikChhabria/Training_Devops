Problem Statement:


You are tasked with setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to streamline the deployment process of a simple Java application. The pipeline should accomplish the following tasks:


Fetch the Dockerfile: The pipeline should clone a GitHub repository containing the source code of the Java application and a Dockerfile.


Create a Docker Image: The pipeline should build a Docker image from the fetched Dockerfile.


Push the Docker Image: The pipeline should push the created Docker image to a specified DockerHub repository.


Deploy the Container: The pipeline should deploy a container using the pushed Docker image.

Deliverables:
GitHub Repository: A GitHub repository containing:

The source code of a simple Java application.
A Dockerfile for building the Docker image.
Jenkins Pipeline Script: A Jenkinsfile 
(pipeline script) that:
Clones the GitHub repository.
Builds the Docker image.
Pushes the Docker image to DockerHub.
Deploys a container using the pushed image.
DockerHub Repository: A DockerHub repository where the Docker images will be stored.


Jenkins Setup:


Jenkins installed and configured on a local Ubuntu machine.
Required plugins installed (e.g., Git, Docker, Pipeline).
Documentation: Detailed documentation 


explaining:
How to set up the local Jenkins environment.
