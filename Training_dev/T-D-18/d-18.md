Project 01

Problem Statement

You are tasked with deploying a three-tier web application (frontend,
backend, and database) using Ansible roles.

The frontend is an Nginx web server, the backend is a Node.js
application, and the database is a MySQL server.

Your solution should use Ansible Galaxy roles where applicable and
define appropriate role dependencies.

The deployment should be automated to ensure that all components are
configured correctly and can communicate with each other.

Steps and Deliverables

Define Project Structure

Create a new Ansible project with a suitable directory structure to
organize roles, playbooks, and inventory files.

Role Selection and Creation

Select appropriate roles from Ansible Galaxy for each tier of the
application:

Nginx for the frontend.

Node.js for the backend.

MySQL for the database.

Create any custom roles needed for specific configurations that are not
covered by the Galaxy roles.

Dependencies Management

Define dependencies for each role in the meta/main.yml file.

Ensure that the roles have appropriate dependencies, such as ensuring
the database is set up before deploying the backend.

Inventory Configuration

Create an inventory file that defines the groups of hosts for each tier
(frontend, backend, database).

Ensure proper group definitions and host variables as needed.

Playbook Creation

Role Customization and Variable Definition

Customize the roles by defining the necessary variables in group_vars or
host_vars as needed for the environment.

Ensure sensitive data like database credentials are managed securely.

Testing and Validation

Create a separate playbook for testing the deployment (test.yml) that
verifies each tier is functioning correctly and can communicate with the
other tiers.

Use Ansible modules and tasks to check the status of services and
applications.

Documentation

Document the setup process, including any prerequisites, role
dependencies, and how to run the playbooks.

Include a README.md file that provides an overview of the project and
instructions for use.
