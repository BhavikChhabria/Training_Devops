# Git Project D-2

## Project Setup

### Install Git
Ensure Git is installed on your system. Verify with:
```bash
git --version

git clone https://github.com/bha1212002/website-project.git


Exercise 1: Branching and Basic Operations
Create a New Branch

bash

git checkout -b feature/add-about-page

Create about.html

bash

touch src/about.html
echo '<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>About Us</title></head><body><h1>About Us</h1></body></html>' > src/about.html

Commit and Push Changes

bash

git add src/about.html
git commit -m "Added about page"
git push origin feature/add-about-page

Exercise 2: Merging and Handling Merge Conflicts
Create Another Branch

bash

git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/update-homepage

    Update the Homepage:
    Modify index.html:

    bash

echo '<p>Updated homepage content</p>' >> src/index.html

Commit and push changes:

bash

git add src/index.html
git commit -m "Updated homepage content"
git push origin feature/update-homepage

Create a Merge Conflict:
Modify index.html on the feature/add-about-page branch:

bash

git checkout feature/add-about-page
echo '<p>Conflict content</p>' >> src/index.html
git add src/index.html
git commit -m "Added conflicting content to homepage"
git push origin feature/add-about-page

Merge and Resolve Conflict:
Attempt to merge feature/add-about-page into main:

bash

git checkout main
git merge feature/add-about-page

Resolve the conflict in src/index.html, then:

bash

    git add src/index.html
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in homepage"
    git push origin main

Exercise 3: Rebasing
Rebase a Branch

Rebase feature/update-homepage onto main:

bash

git checkout feature/update-homepage
git rebase main

Resolve any conflicts that arise during rebase.
Push the Rebased Branch

bash

git push -f origin feature/update-homepage

Exercise 4: Pulling and Collaboration
Pull Changes from Remote

Ensure the main branch is up-to-date:

bash

git checkout main
git pull origin main

Simulate a Collaborator's Change

Make a change on GitHub directly (e.g., edit index.html).
Pull Collaborator's Changes

Pull the changes made by the collaborator:

bash

git pull origin main

Exercise 5: Versioning and Rollback
Tagging a Version

Tag the current commit as v1.0:

bash

git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0: Initial release"
git push origin v1.0

Make a Change that Needs Reversion

Modify index.html:

bash

echo '<p>Incorrect update</p>' >> src/index.html
git add src/index.html
git commit -m "Incorrect update"
git push origin main

Revert to a Previous Version

Use git revert to undo the last commit:

bash

git revert HEAD
git push origin main

Extra Activities
Stashing Changes

Make some local changes without committing:

bash

echo '<p>Uncommitted changes</p>' >> src/index.html

Stash the changes:

bash

git stash

Apply the stashed changes:

bash

git stash apply

Viewing Commit History

Use git log to view commit history:

bash

git log --oneline

Cherry-Picking Commits

Create a new branch and cherry-pick a commit from another branch:

bash

git checkout -b feature/cherry-pick
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
git push origin feature/cherry-pick

Interactive Rebase

Use interactive rebase to squash commits:

bash

git checkout main
git rebase -i HEAD~3

Collaborative Blogging Platform
Objective

You will work on a project to collaboratively develop a simple blogging platform. You will practice various Git concepts including branching, merging, handling merge conflicts, rebasing, pulling, versioning, rolling back changes, stashing, and cherry-picking commits. The project is designed to be completed in 1.5 hours.
Create a GitHub Repository

Create a new repository named blogging-platform on GitHub. Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/blogging-platform.git

Initialize the Project

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd blogging-platform

Create the initial project structure:

bash

mkdir src
touch src/index.html
echo '<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Blogging Platform</title></head><body><h1>Welcome to the Blogging Platform!</h1></body></html>' > src/index.html

Commit and push the initial project structure:

bash

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added project structure and index.html"
git push origin main

Exercise 1: Branching and Adding Features
Create a New Branch for Blog Post Feature

bash

git checkout -b feature/add-blog-post

    Add a Blog Post Page:
    Create blog.html:

    bash

touch src/blog.html
echo '<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Blog Post</title></head><body><h1>My First Blog Post</h1></body></html>' > src/blog.html

Commit and push changes:

bash

    git add src/blog.html
    git commit -m "Added blog post page"
    git push origin feature/add-blog-post

Exercise 2: Collaborating with Merging and Handling Merge Conflicts
Create Another Branch for Author Info

bash

git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/add-author-info

    Add Author Info to Blog Page:
    Modify blog.html:

    bash

echo '<p>Author: John Doe</p>' >> src/blog.html

Commit and push changes:

bash

git add src/blog.html
git commit -m "Added author info to blog post"
git push origin feature/add-author-info

Create a Merge Conflict:
Modify blog.html on the feature/add-blog-post branch:

bash

git checkout feature/add-blog-post
echo '<p>Published on: July 10, 2024</p>' >> src/blog.html
git add src/blog.html
git commit -m "Added publish date to blog post"
git push origin feature/add-blog-post

Merge and Resolve Conflict:
Attempt to merge feature/add-blog-post into main:

bash

git checkout main
git merge feature/add-blog-post

Resolve the conflict in src/blog.html, then:

bash

    git add src/blog.html
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in blog post"
    git push origin main

Exercise 3: Rebasing and Feature Enhancement
Rebase a Branch for Comment Feature

Rebase feature/add-author-info onto main:

bash

git checkout feature/add-author-info
git rebase main

Resolve any conflicts that arise during rebase.
Add Comment Section

Modify blog.html to add a comment section:

bash

echo '<h2>Comments</h2><p>No comments yet.</p>' >> src/blog.html
git add src/blog.html
git commit -m "Added comment section"
git push origin feature/add-author-info
